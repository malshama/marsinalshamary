<p>My research entails a lot of fieldwork (primarily in Iraq, though occasionally in other places in the MENA region). My fieldwork experience has involved a wide range of activities from interviews, to setting up surveys, visiting archives and being a participant observer. It has contributed to different phases of different projects. In some instances, it has inspired research puzzles. Other times, it has helped me develop a theory to answer a puzzle. Of course, my fieldwork has been critical for data collection. </p>
