Hello everyone and welcome to my website. My name is Marsin (pronounced “mar-seen”) and I’m an Iraqi-American PhD candidate in comparative politics at MIT. Before MIT, I spent four wonderful years studying International Relations at Wellesley College, where I was an Albright Fellow. In the upcoming academic year (2019-2020), I will be joining the Middle East Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School as a pre-doctoral research fellow.

I am broadly interested in the intersection of religion and politics in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Shi’ism. More specifically, I study the role of clerics in formal politics (e.g. elections, political parties) and informal politics (e.g. protests, social movements, and civil society). My dissertation (Prophets and Priests: Religious Leaders and Anti-Government Protest in Iraq) explores the political involvement of the Iraqi Shi’a religious establishment (the Hawza) in over a century of anti-government protest. If you’re interested in how I ended up doing research on Iraqi clerics, you can read my <a target="_blank" href="https://news.mit.edu/2016/from-babylon-to-baudelaire-and-back-marsin-alshamary-0526">story</a> here (spoiler alert: it involves clerics and failed revolutions).

As an MIT student, I strongly believe that research should be useful and ethical. To that end, I strive to make my research policy-relevant, collaborative and transparent. As a result, I have written op-eds for various outlets, given presentations to various policymakers, and cooperated with Iraqi clerics and academics in peacebuilding and interfaith workshops.

 I firmly believe in giving back to my community and paying good deeds forward. As a student, I’ve received excellent guidance from several mentors at MIT and at Wellesley. As a researcher during fieldwork, I’ve benefited from the kindness of many Iraqis who have gone out of their way to help me access resources. I hope to pay these kindnesses forward and encourage anyone to reach out if I may be of use to them. As a Wellesley alumna, I feel compelled to add that my door is always open to other women in the discipline and also to those who may be interested in learning more about getting a PhD in political science. Please feel free to reach out! </p>

When I’m not doing research or thinking about Middle Eastern politics, I am reading novels (and blogging about them), writing stories (one of which is set in 1920s Iraq and involves a cleric), and otherwise living the life of a stereotypical Bostonian who enjoys running by the Charles and drinking unhealthy amounts of coffee.
