Hello everyone and welcome to my website. My name is Marsin (pronounced “mar-seen”) and I’m
an Iraqi-American researcher working between Baghdad, Boston, and Washington D.C. I am a
research fellow with the Middle East Initiative at the Belfer Center for Science and International
Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School and a non-resident fellow with the Brookings Institution’s
Center on Middle East Policy with the Foreign Policy Program.

I am currently working on my book manuscript, A Century of the Hawza: how Clerics Shaped Protests and
Politics in Iraq which is based on my <a target="_blank" href="https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/130603">dissertation project</a>. My book examines the history of clerical
interventions in Iraqi politics and protest from 1914 to 2020. In addition to my work on religious
leadership, I also have an ongoing project about women’s political participation in Iraq, with support
from the Canadian International Development Research Center [link: https://www.idrc.ca/en]. My
third major research area is protest and civil society development, on which I have written several
articles which you can find in my research section.

I enjoy working on academic projects with policy impact and have served as a consultant with
several international organizations focusing on peacebuilding, democratization, and postwar
reconstruction in Iraq.
